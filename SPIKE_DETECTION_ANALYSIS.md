# Spike Detection Analysis & Improvement Plan

## Current Logic Overview

### **Existing Detection Method:**

- **Volume Threshold**: Tokens with > (X) SOL total volume
- **Buyer Diversity**: Minimum (X) unique buyer(s)
- **Age Filter**: Only tokens â‰¤ (X) minutes old

### **Current Algorithm:**

```text
FOR each token in memory:
  IF age < (X) minutes 
  AND total_volume > (X) SOL 
  AND unique_buyers >= (X)
  THEN mark as "hot token"
```

### **Weaknesses:**

**Static thresholds** - no market adaptation  
**Accumulation-based** - misses velocity spikes  
**No baseline comparison** - can't detect relative anomalies

## Required Improvements

### **1. Velocity-Based Detection**

**Add rate-of-change analysis:**

- Volume velocity (SOL/minute trending)
- Buyer acquisition rate (new buyers/timeframe)
- Transaction frequency acceleration
- Price momentum (if available)

### **2. Dynamic Thresholds (Not sure)**

**Replace static limits with adaptive ones:**

- Market-relative volume thresholds
- Token-specific historical baselines
- Time-of-day volume adjustments
- Volatility-adjusted sensitivity

### **3. Multi-Timeframe Analysis (Not sure)**

**Implement sliding window detection:**

- 1-minute burst detection
- 5-minute momentum tracking
- 15-minute trend confirmation
- Cross-timeframe spike validation

### **4. Statistical Anomaly Detection**

**Add mathematical sophistication:**

- Z-score analysis for volume deviations
- Standard deviation-based spike identification
- Moving averages for baseline establishment
- Percentile-based threshold calculation

### **5. Pattern Recognition**

**Detect specific spike patterns:**

- Pump-and-dump signatures
- Organic growth vs artificial pumps
- Whale activity vs retail frenzy
- Coordinated buying patterns

### **6. Market Context Integration**

**Consider broader market conditions:**

- Overall Solana network activity
- Correlation with major token movements
- DEX-specific volume patterns
- Time-based activity normalization

### **7. Quality Scoring System**

**Replace binary hot/not-hot with scoring:**

- Composite spike confidence score (0-100)
- Individual metric contributions
- Risk assessment (pump likelihood)
- Sustainability prediction
